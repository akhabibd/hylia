This is a good intro, to be honest, (not really). I'm currently a Juniors majoring in Islamic economics at Universitas Airlangga. I was a CS and Q-Programing enthusiast up until now. I spend my free time doing these things and felt like I have no friends other than my high school mate.

A sensible way while not in front of my laptop is probably sketching, reading, taking notes, playing Dota 2 (currently not) or trying to familiarize myself with friends (nongkrong). **My main interest is harnessing my ability and data for societal impact**. I'd be happy to learn more about these so feel free to reach me out at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/khabibdee), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmad-khabib-dwi-anggara-5945a8192/), or email.
