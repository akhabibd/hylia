> You cannot let a fear of failure or a fear of comparison or a fear of judgment stop you from doing what's makes you great. You cannot succeed without the risk of failure.You cannot have a voice without the risk of criticism. And you cannot love without the risk of loss. You must go out and take these risks, and people will tell you to do what makes you happy. But a lot of this has been hard work. and I am not always happy, and I don't think you should do what makes you happy, I think you should do what makes you great. do what's uncomfortable, and scary, and hard but pays off in the long run. be willing to fail, let yourself fail, fail in the way in the place where you would want to fail. fail, pick yourself up, and fail again. but without this struggle what is your success anyway?
